The positional league endpoints provide a paginated list of all summoners in a Tier + Division + Position (e.g. all ranked Diamond II Top laners). Alternatively, Canisback on the Discord currently hosts a list of league IDs that you can use to pull summoners from the leagues/{leagueId} endpoints. These lists are provided for free to the community for use, and may go down or stop being updated at any time.\n",
